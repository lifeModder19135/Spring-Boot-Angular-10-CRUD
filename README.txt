This Project will contain a ReSTful api designed to work as a backend alongside an Angular frontend.
 The front end will be contained in a similarly named project appended by the '_front-end' tag.
 This version will be a template to store on github and to use as a starting point for the majority
 of Ng-SB web app stacks that I build in the future. 
 
 For the template, the endpoints will be:
 
      - /users     GET
      - /users/id  GET
      - /users/id  POST
      - /users/id  PUT
      - /users/id  DELETE
